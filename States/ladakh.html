<u><h2>1.Pangong Lake:</h2></u>
    <img src="c:\Users\megha\Downloads\pangong-lake.webp" width="700" height="300">
    <br><b>Pangong Tso</b> is a lake in Leh Ladakh, which derives its name from the Tibetan word, 
    ‚ÄúPangong Tso‚Äù, which means ‚Äúhigh grassland lake‚Äù. <br>The lake is known for its beauty and is famous for changing colors, 
    appearing blue, green and red at different times. <br>Pangong Tso is strategically crucial as it is very close to Chusul Valley, 
    which was one of the battlefronts between India and China during the 1962 war2. 
    <br>China appears to keep India constricted in the region by taking strategic advantage of looking over the Chusul Valley, 
    which it can do if it advances along Pangong Tso.
    <u><h2>Unique features of Pangong Lake :</h2></u>
    <ul type="disk">
<li>One of the world's highest saltwater lakes.</li>
<li>Completely landlocked and unable to drain anywhere.</li>
 <li>Set at an elevation of 14,270 feet.</li>
<li>Panoramic views of steep valleys and arid landscape.</li> 
<li>Water dyed in blue.</li>
<u><h2>Things to do at pangong lake:</u></h2>
<ul type="disk">
<li>Camping</li>
<li>Stargazing</li>
<li>Three Idiots Point</li>
<li>Stone Fish</li>
<u><h1>Best time to visit Pangong Lake:</h1></u>
The most preferred time to visit Pangong is, of course, the summer season i.e. from June to September. 
<u><h1>How to Stay Safe and Healthy:</h1></u>
Altitude sickness is a major health concern when visiting Pangong Lake. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it can affect anyone more than 8,000 feet (2,500 meters) above sea level. 
The thinner air means there's less oxygen to breathe, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the body's blood (hypoxemia) and tissues (hypoxia). 
Symptoms may commonly range from mild headache and fatigue, to the rarer build-up of fluid in the lungs or brain. 
Therefore, acclimatization is to be taken seriously, otherwise you may end up dangerously ill.
<u><h1>Here‚Äôs what you can do!:</h1></u> Get a complete physical check up to make sure you have no serious health issues. If you have a blood pressure problem, do consult your doctor before planning the trip. Rest properly for at least 48 hours. Review the symptoms of mountain sickness so you can recognize and treat them quickly.<br>

<u><h2>5.Khardung-La Pass ‚Äì A scenic motorable pass:</h2></u>
<img src="https://www.tourmyindia.com/states/ladakh/imagess/khardung-la-pass3.jpg" height="300" width="500"<>
       <br>
       
       <b>Khardung La</b> is one of the highest motorable roads in the world and a daunting pass that fills the nerves of the travelers with thrill and joy. 
        Situated at an altitude of 18,379 ft. above sea level, Khardung La makes one feel at the top of the world.
         Alternatively known as the ‚ÄòPass of Lower Castle‚Äô, Khardung La is the inspiration of motorbike, automobile, and mountain biking expeditions. 
         This makes it an adventure aficionados‚Äô paradise indeed. It also connects Leh with the Zanskar and Nubra Region which makes it an important element of the entire Ladakh Circuit.<br>
         <br>
         <h3>History of Khardung La</h3>
        <b>This mountain </b>pass in the newly made union territory of Ladakh was constructed for motors in 1976 and opened in 1988 for the public. 
It was during the Second World War when the first attempt to give a war well to China was done through this route. 
Like every other high altitude pass, Khardung La is also maintained by BRO (Border Roads Organisation). 
This road is not only important to India from a tourism point of view but holds strategic importance as well. It is a way to carry goods and troops to the Siachen Glacier making this a very important pass for India.
<br>
<br>
  <img src="c:\Users\megha\Downloads\bike.webp" height="300" width="400">

<u><h1>Weather in Khardung La:</h1></u>
<br><b>Summers</b> are comfortable but it can snow at any point in time owing to the high altitude but the months between May to August are the best time to visit Khardung La. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can visit here. 
The temperature at this point varies abruptly depending on the clouds that make it pretty difficult to predict the temperature here. But during winters the temperature can go as low as -40 degrees and in summers it can go up to 20 degrees.
 And when it snows, there have been times when the place gets wrapped in 10 feet high snow sheets but all thanks to BRO they keep clearing the snow for easy commuting.
 <br>
 <u><h1>Road Conditions to Reach Khardung La:</h1></u>
 The distance between Leh city and Khardung La is approximately 40 km with a stretch of patchy road and a major portion being muddy, filled with snow melted slush, granules, and a lot more challenges. Reaching Khardung La is one of a kind feeling. But, it isn‚Äôt a child‚Äôs play to be at such an altitude.
<br>
The first 24 km of the road from Leh to Khardung Pass, i.e. till South Pullu checkpoint is made up of concrete. The next 16 km of the road, i.e. till North Pullu is uneven, consisting of dirt, loose rocks, and some puddles with snow melted water.
<br>
<u><h1>Things to carry while traveling to Khardung La:</u></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Take acute mountain sickness seriously and get acclimated well before heading to the pass.</li>
