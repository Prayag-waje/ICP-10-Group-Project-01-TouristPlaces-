    </center>In 1891, for example, the women‚Äôs protests forced a backtrack on reforms introduced by the British colonizers that favored external trade over them. In 1939, angered at the British policy of exporting local rice to other parts of India, they confronted the army in what was the Anishuba Nupilan, or Second Women‚Äôs War ‚Äì and won.
